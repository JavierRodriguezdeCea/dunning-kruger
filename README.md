# Random number simulation of the Dunning–Kruger experiment

The Dunning–Kruger effect is a cognitive bias wherein people with limited competence in a particular domain overestimate their abilities. It turns out that the Dunning–Kruger experiments do not prove that the effect is real. This app illustrates this using a random number simulation. The data generation process doesn't imply that "incompetent" participants overestimate their abilities. See more details in the [blog post](https://e10v.me/debunking-dunning-kruger-effect/).
