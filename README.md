# Random number simulation of the Dunning and Kruger experiments

## Overview

The Dunning–Kruger effect suggests that people with low competence in a domain often overestimate their abilities. But do the foundational experiments truly confirm this effect? This app offers a random number simulation challenging those original findings. For a deep dive into the topic, check out my blog post [Debunking the Dunning–Kruger effect with random number simulation](https://e10v.me/debunking-dunning-kruger-effect/).

## Try the live demo

Experience the simulation firsthand. Visit the app hosted on Streamlit Community Cloud: [Random number simulation of the Dunning and Kruger experiments](https://dunning-kruger.streamlit.app).
